## Background
This project used a logistic regression function to pinpoint frauduent credit card transactions. It is important that we look at both the false positive rate and the true positive rate as in a real world scenario, fraudulent transactions only make up a small percentage of all transactions recorded.

## The Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shubhamjoshi2130of/abstract-data-set-for-credit-card-fraud-detection). It includes fields such as the average transaction amount for the card, the amount for this transaction, whether the transaction was declined and whether it was a foreign transaction. You can see a sample of the data below.
