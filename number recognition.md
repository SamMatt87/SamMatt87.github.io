## Background
In this project, the models looks at images of hand written numbers and attempts to predict the numbers they represent. The project tests three different naive bayes models from the sklearn naive bayes package. These models include the Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernouli Naive Bayes cateories of models. The project also shows a plot that visualises some of the inputs.

## The Dataset
The dataset used for this project was an mnist dataset. It can be found on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/avnishnish/mnist-original). Each image is stored as 784 values, each representing a pixel of a 28 by 28 square with an intesity level between white and black. The dataset contains 70,000 images of the numbers 0 to 9. An example of one of the images can be seen below.
