## Background
This was one of my first data science projects. I decided to run some models on the Titanic dataset considered by many to be the "Hello World" of data science. The goal of this project was to use details about the passengers to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## The Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rahulsah06/titanic). It includes details such as the class they were travelling in, their gender, their age as well as other important variables including whether or not the passenger survied. A smple of the data can be seen below.
