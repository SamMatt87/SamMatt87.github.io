## Background
This project uses the weather data for locations across Australia to predict whether or not it will rain there tomorrow. It uses different measurements of variables such as temperature, wind, air pressure, cloud cover and whether or not it rained today and feeds them into a decision tree model to make this prediction. It also outputs a visual representaion of the decision tree.

## The Dataset
THe dataset was sourced from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). It includes measurements of different weather related variables at the location at different points throughout the day including the minimum and maximum temperatures, the level of rainfall, the level of evaporation, the number of hours of sunshine, the direction and speed of the strongest wind throughout the day, the direction and speed of the wind at 9am and 3pm, the hunmidity at 9am and 3pm, the pressure at 9am and 3pm, the level of cloud cover at 9am and 3pm, the temperature at 9am and 3pm, wheter or not it rained today and whether or not it will rain tomorrow. You can see a sample of the data below.
