I created this page to showcase my data science skills to potential employers. Below you will find a short introduction about me and links to pages about my personal data science projects broken down by category.

### About Me

My name is Sam Matthews, I am a 33 year old male currently living in Sydney, Australia. Having recently graduated from a Master's of Data Science with the University of New South Wales, I am looking to start my career as a Data Scientist. I am no stranger to the world of data, over the last four and a half years I have worked as a Data Analyst for a number of Australia's largest companies and government organisations. My experience gained has given me skills in a number of areas including:
- SQL used for both simple and complex queries
- Python used in the ETL process to extract data from other databases or excel spreadsheets, transform the data into new formats and schemas and load the transformed data into a database
- Presenting insights into data using tools such as Tableau, Qlik Sense and Power BI
- Liasing with both technical and non-technical stakeholders about project requirements as well as any outcomes and insights

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SamMatt87/SamMatt87.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SamMatt87/SamMatt87.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
