# Sam's Data Science Projects

## Introduction

I created this page to showcase my data science skills to potential employers. Below you will find a short introduction about me and links to pages about my personal data science projects broken down by category.

## About Me

My name is Sam Matthews, I am a 33 year old male currently living in Sydney, Australia. Having recently graduated from a Master's of Data Science with the University of New South Wales, I am looking to start my career as a Data Scientist. I am no stranger to the world of data, over the last four and a half years I have worked as a Data Analyst for a number of Australia's largest companies and government organisations. My experience gained has given me skills in a number of areas including:
- SQL used for both simple and complex queries
- Python used in the ETL process to extract data from other databases or excel spreadsheets, transform the data into new formats and schemas and load the transformed data into a database
- Presenting insights into data using tools such as Tableau, Qlik Sense and Power BI
- Liasing with both technical and non-technical stakeholders about project requirements as well as any outcomes and insights

Throughout my recent Master's I have been learning further skils to make the transition into a data science career. I have also been practicing and improving upon those skills through the various projects shown below. These skills included:
- Using python to preprocess and explore massive datasets
- Using models from the SciKitLearn Python module to create models based on various modelling techniques
- Creating Neural Networks with Tensorflow and Pytorch
- Comparing the outputs of different models to find the most suitable in terms of accuracy and understandablity

## Projects
### [Basic SciKitLearn Projects](https://sammatt87.github.io/SciKitLearn-basics/)
These are projects that I used to practice my skills in SciKitLearn models before I undertook my Masters degree.

### [Image Recognition Projects](https://sammatt87.github.io/Image-Recognition/)
Image clssification tasks using various sklearn models and Neural Networks.

### [Natural Language Processing Projects](https://sammatt87.github.io/NLP/)
Various Natural Language processing tasks using sklearn models and Neural Networks

### [Prediction Projects](https://sammatt87.github.io/Prediction)
Projects used to predict outcomes such as customer churn or flight delays using various sklearn models

### [Fun Python Projects](https://sammatt87.github.io/Fun)
Just some fun projects showing off skills like web scraping
