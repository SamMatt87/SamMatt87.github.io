My name is Sam Matthews, I am a 36 year old male currently living in Sydney, Australia. I am currently looking for a role as a Data Scientist. I am no stranger to the world of data, since 2017 I have worked as a Data Analyst for a number of Australia's largest companies and government organisations and I have 2 years experience as a Software Engineer focusing on machine learning for a consultancy with global reach. My experience gained has given me skills in a number of areas including:
- SQL used for both simple and complex queries as well as building and maintaining databases
- Python used in the ETL process to extract data from other databases or excel spreadsheets, transform the data into new formats and schemas and load the transformed data into a database
- Presenting insights into data using tools such as Tableau, Qlik Sense and Power BI
- Liasing with both technical and non-technical stakeholders about project requirements as well as any outcomes and insights
- Building and maintaining supervised neural networks focused on image recognition
